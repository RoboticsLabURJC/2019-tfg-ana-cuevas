Hello, I'm Ana Cuevas, this is is the blog documenting the advances of my final project.

The project consist of several exercises to learn about image processing in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

The tutors of the project are:

- [Jose Maria Ca√±as](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/)
- [Inmaculada Mora](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/inmaculadamora)
